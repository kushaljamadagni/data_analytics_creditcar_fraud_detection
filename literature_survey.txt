ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud is increasing considerably with the development of modern technology and the global superhighways of communication. Credit card fraud costs consumers and the financial company billions of dollars annually, and fraudsters continuously try to find new rules and tactics to commit illegal actions. Thus, fraud detection systems have become essential for banks and financial institution, to minimize their losses. However, there is a lack of published literature on credit card fraud detection techniques, due to the unavailable credit card transactions dataset for researchers. The most commonly techniques used fraud detection methods are Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms (KNN). These techniques can be used alone or in collaboration using ensemble or meta-learning techniques to build classifiers. But amongst all existing method, ensemble learning methods are identified as popular and common method, not because of its quite straightforward implementation, but also due to its exceptional predictive performance on practical problems. In this paper we trained various data mining techniques used in credit card fraud detection and evaluate each methodology based on certain design criteria. After several trial and comparisons; we introduced the bagging classifier based on decision three, as the best classifier to construct the fraud detection model. The performance evaluation is performed on real life credit card transactions dataset to demonstrate the benefit of the bagging ensemble algorithm.

The proposed techniques are used in this paper, for detecting the frauds in credit card system. The comparison are made for different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, to determine which algorithm gives suits best and can be adapted by credit card merchants for identifying fraud transactions

The algorithms used are random forest algorithm and the Adaboost algorithm. The results of the two algorithms are based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ROC curve is plotted based on the confusion matrix. The Random Forest and the Adaboost algorithms are compared and the algorithm that has the greatest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score is considered as the best algorithm that is used to detect the fraud.

Our Problem statement:the problem statement we are focusing on is to use three different machine learning algorithms to detect credit card frauds and compare the accuracy among them .the algorithms we are focusing on are:1)k-means 2)logistic regression 3)neural networks
Based on the initial exploratory analysis on the dataset we found out that there are no missing values present in the dataset whereas the dataset is found to be highly unbalanced.We tried to find out the correlation between the columns but we found there is no notable correlation between features V1-V28. There are certain correlations between some of these features and Time (inverse correlation with V3) and Amount (direct correlation with V7 and V20, inverse correlation with V1 and V5).
